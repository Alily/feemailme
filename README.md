## Express React-Redux Project 
#### This project is currently a work in progress.

This web application:
- Lets users sign up via Google OAuth.
- Maintains MongoDB of users.
- Uses cookie management.
- Logged-in users can:
  - Purchase application credits via Stripe.
  - View their available credits in the Header bar.
  - Log out.
  - Create custom yes/no answer email surveys with basic error checking on field data entry.(To be implemented: survey review and submission).
  - (To be implemented:) Use credits to send out their created surveys to people. (Sendgrid wiring is done, but UI components are not.)

The name is a cheesy pun since I'm cool like that.
